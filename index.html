        <h1>Warriors to Dubs</h1><!--Center with CSS-->
        <!--insert img of warriors court or logo-->
        <p>Before the 2010's, most of the years involved the Golden State Warriors being mediocre and if not, one of the worst teams in the NBA.
            It was not until recently that the Warriors dynasty took place with the Warriors winning 4 NBA championships in the last 10 years.
        These are some factors that took place in this timespan that turned the Warriors into their nickname, the Dubs.</p>
